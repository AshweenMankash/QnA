      "content": "Hey guys,\nA few students have asked me about this issue when the web page renders just fine, but when you do a search, the elements are duplicate.\nWhat happens is when the web page loads, it&#39;ll go through all the twit elements and save them in a global variable.\nThen it uses that information to re-insert all the twits after a search.\nThe problem is in index.html or main.handlebars, index.js was included twice.\nSo it&#39;ll go through all the twits twice and add duplicate information into that global variable.\nTake out one of the js script, rebuild the template and it should fix the problem (or maybe not)\nLet me know if it still doesn&#39;t work.\n\n\nanother thing is if you directly push to the global array, thats not good, just insert into dom and the array with implicitely update on the next filter.\nHappy coding!\n#pin"
