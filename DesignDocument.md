Piazza QnA web application

Posts on piazza are unable to be retrieved and used after the semester is over to new students.And most students wish to unsubscribe from the piazza class after the term is over. It is hard to reuse posts.

In this application the python server updates and archives a class into its database, and through the web application one can find answers to their solution, these are read only, and can only be mentioned in a future piazza post for the current class.
